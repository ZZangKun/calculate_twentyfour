# calculate_twentyfour
##"Calculate twenty-four" is a game that randomly picks four cards, and you will need to calculate 24 using all four numbers with +, -, *, or /. Written in C++, this calculator calculates the output and shows the detailed process. For example, if you input 1, 2, 3, and 4, the output will be "2+1=3 3+3=6 6*4=24". ps: I did this project in my freshman year in high school, but it's only working for most of the time; sometimes it will produce errors (still fixing that!).
