# calculate_twentyfour
"Calculate twenty-four" is a game that randomly picks four cards, and you will need to calculate 24 using all four numbers with +, -, *, or /. Written in C++, this calculator calculates the output and shows the detailed process. For example, if you input 1, 2, 3, and 4, the output will be "2+1=3 3+3=6 6Ã—4=24". ps: I did this project in my freshman year in high school, but it's only working most of the time; sometimes it will produce errors (still fixing that!).

## How to use it?
1. Download the main.cpp file in your computer
2. Import the file into a C++ IDE of your choice, make sure you have the environment ready (such as CMake file).
3. Run the program and give proper input: 4 integers.
